Fuelled by pixels and semicolons, I'm a programming student navigating the exciting intersection of gaming and web development. My journey is a blend of programming sessions and immersive gaming experiences, where both worlds fuel my creativity and problem-solving skills. Currently, I'm diving deep into the fundamentals, building a solid foundation with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

My primary focus lies in crafting engaging web experiences and exploring the possibilities of game development. I'm passionate about bringing interactive ideas to life, whether it's through sleek website designs or the mechanics of a captivating game. Every line of code is a step towards realizing my vision of creating compelling digital experiences.

When I'm not immersed in code or gaming, you'll find me on Instagram, sharing glimpses of my creative process and gaming adventures at [cookies_wrixle](https://www.instagram.com/cookies_wrixle?igsh=eG1vdnNhYmYwZjA=) on instargram.
